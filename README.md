# uniwill-laptop
Linux kernel driver for various Uniwill laptops. Keep in mind that this kernel module is still
a prototype, you might seriously damage our laptop by loading this driver.

## Installation
You can build the kernel module by simply executing `make`. Keep in mind that you need a recent enough linux kernel (>= 6.10.0)
and the linux kernel headers installed.

You can then load the kernel module by executing `insmod uniwill-laptop.ko` with superuser privileges.

## Development

This driver is based on [qc71_laptop](https://github.com/pobrn/qc71_laptop) and [tuxedo-driver](https://github.com/tuxedocomputers/tuxedo-drivers).
All knowledge was retrieved using reverse engineering, so be careful when testing this driver!
